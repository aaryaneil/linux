<strong>Assignment - 1*</strong>

Step 1: Download and Install VMWare Workstation.

Step 2: Download ubuntu iso and create a Virtual Machine in Workstation.

Step 3 : In processor setting select nested virtualization capabilities, this allows us to run a VM inside another VM

Step 4: Fork the original linux repo from Linus Torvalds’ github.

Step 5: Check VM’s virtualization capabilitiesusing  the command cat /proc/cpuinfo.

Step 6: Install git on the VM by using the command "sudo apt-get-install git"

Step 7 :Clone the repository which we forked earlier from torvalds/linux

Step 8: Run cd linux to siwtch to the repo which we just cloned

Step 9: In cmpe283-1.c file add the sections of code for primary procbased controls, secondary procbased controls, entry and exit controls based on the SDM.

Step 10: Add the modified cmpe283-1.c file and the Makefile to a folder cmpe283 and put the folder under the cloned linux directory
switch to the linux directory

Step 11: Run "uname -a" command to check the version (check if there is a version mismatch between the cloned version and the current vm linux distribution we are running)

Step 12: In order to run certain make commmands we need to run certain install "sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev flex bison openssl libssl-dev dkms libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf"

Step 13: Follow the following sequence of commands to build and install the kernel modules

Step 14: make menuconfig" (do not save any changes in the UI and exit it )

Step 15: cp /boot/config-{curent version we got from "uname -a" command without braces} .config"

Step 16: make oldconfig" (press enter to answer all the questions)

Step 17: make prepare"

Step 18:”make -j {no. of cores on the processor} modules" eg : "make -j 4 modules"

Step 19 :If there is an error similar to"* No rule to make target 'debian/canonical-certs.pem'"

Step 20: vi the .config file and set the system trusted keys and revocation keys strings = ""

Step 21: after the "make -j 4 modules" command is sucessfuly finished

Step 22: "make -j 4"

Step 23: After this command is succesfully finished we will see a "is ready" statement in the end

Step 24: "sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install"

Step 25: ”sudo make install"

Step 26: ”sudo reboot"

Step 27: run "uname -a" to check that the version has changed (updated to our new complied module)

Step 28: change directory to the drectory we created earlier "cd cmpe283"

Step 29: run "make" command check if there are any errors in the file or an error asking to include license. In case of an error for license, go to the cmpe283-1.c file and at the botton add "MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");" and save the file.

Step 30:  After the make command is successfuly executed run , check that the .ko file is created using "lsmod | grep cmpe283"

Step 31: "sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko" to insert our module

Step 32: Run "dmesg" command

Step 33: We can see the capability info for all the MSR which we have defined in the cmpe283-1.c file undr the heading "Module Start"

Step 34: To remove the module run "sudo rmmod cmpe283-1"

Step 35: run "dmesg" to check the exit message ""Module Exits"









###Assignment -2

Step 1: Start with the Assignment-1 setup

Step 2: Modify the cpuid.c file and vmx.c file as follows

Step 3: Return the total no. of exits in eax for leafnode for eax values as 0x4fffffff

Step 4: Retrun the number of exits in eax for the exit type provided in ecx when the leaf node value is 0x4ffffffd

Step 5: We can find the modified values for cpuid.c under arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c and for vmx.c under arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c

Step 6: We declare 2 extern variables in vmx.c one for total exits and an array to store total exits for each reason

Step 7: We increment the total exits each time there is an exit and we increment the corresponding value for that reason's index in the array

Step 8: save the modifications in both the files

Step 9: Run the following sequence of commands

Step 10: make -j 4 modules

Step 11: make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install && make install

Step 12: run "lsmod | grep kvm" to see if the module is already loaded

Step 13: if the comamnd returns that the module is already loaded run "rmmod kvm" and "rmmod kvm_intel" if both are present

Step 14: run "modprobe kvm"

Step 15: Now in order to test the modifications we made to kvm we need to install a VM inside our VM

Step 16: From the ubuntu software center install virtual machine manager

Step 17: Download the ubuntu iso file and install a ubuntu VM following the same steps followed in Assignment-1

Step 18: Once installed, in the terminal of our inner VM install the cpuid package using the command "sudo apt-get install cpuid"

Step 19: Now we can use the commands "cpuid -l 0x4fffffff" to see the total exits returned in eax

Step 20: Screenshot (193)

Step 21: We can use the command "cpuid -l 0x4fffffffd -s {exit_reason}" where exit reason is an integer for the exit reason for which we want to see the number of exits We can use it for example as "cpuid -l 0x4ffffffd -s 31" to see the number of exits due to RDMSR . Screenshot (191)

Step 22: Questions for 0x4fffffffd :

Step 23: The increase in the number of total exits is not stable. We sometimes see an increase of 422 exits and the other time we see an increase of 677 or 700. We notice a lot of exits for EPT violations , MSR access , IO Instructions.For a full vm reboot we noted around 1174554 exits.

Step 24: The most frequent exits are EPT violations and MSR access and the least frequent exits are 0 (for VMWRITE, triple fault, etc) and there are very few exits for DR_Access,APIC access.
